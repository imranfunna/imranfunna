# **Hello! Welcome to my page!**

My name is Imran and I'm a first-year student studying _Data Science and AI_.\
During my first year we are learning the basics of Data Science, coding in Python, using various libraries such as pandas, numpy and scikit. We're also learning precalculus in semester 1 and calculus and statistics in semester 2
Let's have a breakdown of all the subjects I have, starting with the subjects of semester 1.

## Semester 1
During the first semester we're being taught the very basics of Data Science. We're introduced to *Python* and libraries like *Pandas* and we even end the semester by creating a <ins>predictive model</ins>!\
My first impression of the first semester has been positive so far, this semester has been my introduction to Data Science and I admit that it has really caught my eye. I like coding in notebooks and I love seeing visualisations come to life and _just_ the way I want them to be. But enough of that, let's talk about each subject in semester 1.
