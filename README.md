## 📂 Featured Project

### 🚄 AI-Driven Mobility Optimization & Automation
*Collaborative project for a Mobility Consultancy Firm*

**🏆 Award: Ranked 1st Place (Judges' Vote) at the THUAS ADS&AI Expo 2026**

This project focused on automating the manual consulting process of a mobility firm. We replaced a time-consuming, error-prone manual workflow with three specialized machine learning models to provide faster, more accurate, and tailored insights. Our solution was presented via a professional poster and was awarded **first place** by a panel of industry judges.

**Key Implementations:**
* **Predictive Cost-Optimization (XGBoost):** Developed a classification model to predict the most cost-effective subscription plan for employees by simulating various pricing scenarios.
* **Travel Compliance & Anomaly Detection:** Built a tool to distinguish between legitimate work-related travel and unauthorized trips, allowing consultants to focus on high-priority cases.
* **Employee Segmentation (K-Means Clustering):** Implemented clustering to group travelers based on shared characteristics, enabling personalized mobility policies for clients.

**Tech Stack:** `Python`, `XGBoost`, `Scikit-Learn`, `K-Means`, `Anomaly Detection`, `Pandas`


### ✈️ Multimodal Data Pipeline: Schiphol Flight Delay Predictor
*Technical Research & Data Engineering Project*

This project involved the development of an advanced end-to-end **ETL pipeline** designed to predict flight delays at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Unlike traditional models, this pipeline integrates disparate, multimodal data sources to capture a holistic view of airport operations.



**Key Engineering Milestones:**
* **Multimodal Data Integration:** Engineered a robust pipeline that synchronizes four distinct data types:
    * **Structured:** Real-time flight schedules via the **Schiphol API**.
    * **Unstructured Images:** Automated **Webscraping** of meteorological radar images, processed via **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** to extract precipitation indices.
    * **Unstructured Audio:** Extracted **ATC (Air Traffic Control) communications** from public databases, using **Digital Signal Processing (Librosa)** to quantify controller workload through silence-ratio and spectral analysis.
    * **Unstructured Text:** Scraped and analyzed weather reports using **NLP** for sentiment and risk-keyword detection.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transformed raw signals into high-dimensional feature vectors, including MFCCs for audio and convective core counts for radar data.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Validated the pipeline by training a **Random Forest** classifier to predict delay probabilities based on the integrated dataset.

**Tech Stack:** `Python`, `OpenCV`, `Librosa (Audio)`, `NLP`, `Scikit-Learn`, `SQL (Trino/SQLite)`, `Webscraping (BeautifulSoup)`
