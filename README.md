# **Hello! Welcome to my page!**

My name is Imran and I'm a first-year student studying _Data Science and AI_.\
During my first year we are learning the basics of Data Science, coding in Python, using various libraries such as pandas, numpy and scikit. We're also learning precalculus in semester 1 and calculus and statistics in semester 2
Let's have a breakdown of all the subjects I have, starting with the subjects of semester 1. Semester 2 has not started yet, but as time goes by and we get more subjects I will be updating this readme to inform you of my progress.

## Semester 1
During the first semester we're being taught the very basics of Data Science. We're introduced to *Python* and libraries like *Pandas* and we even end the semester by creating a <ins>predictive model</ins>!\
My first impression of the first semester has been positive so far, this semester has been my introduction to Data Science and I admit that it has really caught my eye. I like coding in notebooks and I love seeing visualisations come to life and _just_ the way I want them to be. But enough of that, let's talk about each subject in semester 1.
### Intro to Data Science & AI
In this subject we learned about the various approaches that Data Science has, including learning about what Data Science actually is. We touched on a lot of terms such as: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Metadata and learned about the Data Science Life Cycle and the methods of working on a project. This subject was meant to give us a good understanding of Data Science and what to expect during this study, ending the subject with having to make a presentation (my group chose it to be in the form of a video) and cater to a certain sector in the working industry to explain what Data Science is and why companies could benefit from it.
### Programming
Programming aimed to give us a basic understanding of how Python worked and how we can utilise Python to help us with Data Science. We learned very basic things, such as how to import libraries, or how to create lists, how to print items and how to create dictionaries. **The rest is under construction**
